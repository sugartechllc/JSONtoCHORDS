## WiPy Artifacts

This directory contains items that were used during the WiPy prototying.

It turns out that the WiPy is not yet robust enough for this job.
The system kept hanging or experiencing mysterious exceptions. I
suspect this had to do with the multithreaded architecture of the
application.
